Activity about Transpiling with Babel....

In this activity, we will practice transpiling JavaScript with Babel. Javascript has features that are not yet able to be used in all browsers. We will transpile ES6+ features to ES5, which is often done in applications to make sure the website is viewable in all browsers.

Install Babel
Run the following in your terminal: npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env

Use Babel to Transpile Our Code
Run the following command in your terminal: npx babel src -d lib
